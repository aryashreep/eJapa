# Japa
Japa (Sanskrit: जप) is the meditative repetition of a mantra or a divine name. It is a practice found in Hinduism, Jainism, Sikhism, Buddhism, and Shintōism. The mantra or name may be spoken softly, enough for the practitioner to hear it, or it may be spoken within the reciter's mind. Japa may be performed while sitting in a meditation posture, while performing other activities, or as part of formal worship in group settings.

## Lord Brahma says:
### Hare Krishna Hare Krishna Krishna Krishna Hare Hare
### Hare Rama Hare Rama Rama Rama Hare Hare

### "This mantra, consisting of 16 words and 32 syllables, is the only means against evil in the age of Kali. After searching through all the Vedic literature, one cannot find a method of religion more sublime for this age than the chanting of Hare Krsna."

### --- Kali-santarana Upanishad
